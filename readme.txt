Gain power to display more with less. Adds new shortcodes to neatly display all your polls in one place.

== Description ==

There have been many instances that my clients want an easy solution to make polls on their website, without too many steps. This is a solution for those who want more power over their polls. With the current version, this plugin adds 2 new powerfull shortcodes to display your polls in an easier way.

The first shortcode adds the ability to display all of your polls in either ascending, or descending order. This gives you the ability to actively share your polls without having to copy and paste new shortcodes every time you create a new poll.

The second shortcode adds the ability to integrate multiple polls in one shortcode. If you would like to show polls with id = 1,6, you can do that with the new shortcode!

While these are the only two new features that this plugin offers currently, I will continue to further the extension of the plugin as time goes on and I as I continue to use the Total Soft poll plugin. If you have any requests for extensions or any suggestions on the current extensions, please reach out!

A few notes about the sections above:


== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= What are the shortcodes that we can use? =

Currently [TS_Poll_All] will display all of the polls that you have created with the Total Soft Poll Plugin. [TSE_Multi id="x,x"] will display all of the polls with the id you put into the id field. You must put the id field for polls to show, where x,x is the id number of the poll you would like to show.

= What are the upcoming features we can expect? =

While we are not entirely sure what features to work on next, you can rest assured that we will continue to further the plugin and that you will get the best extensions for the Total Soft Poll plugin available. We are open to feature requests, so please send them our way!
